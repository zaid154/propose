        <h1>To the Most Special Person in My Life</h1>
        <div class="message">
            I've been thinking about us a lot lately. About all the moments we've shared - the laughter, the quiet
            times, and everything in between.
        </div>

        <div class="message">
            I know you're not someone who talks too much, but I've always felt you have a pure heart. From the first
            time I saw you, I couldn't stop thinking about you. I remember when I first tried to talk to you and sit
            with you, but your best friend walked up to us and I stepped back, feeling unsure.
        </div>

        <div class="message">
            I want to tell you that I've felt so many times that I needed to talk with you, but I held myself back
            because I didn't want to risk our friendship. But today, I realize that what I feel for you is too strong to
            ignore any longer.
        </div>

        <div class="message">
            You make ordinary days feel special just by being there. When we're together, everything feels right in my
            world. I truly can't imagine my life without you in it.
        </div>

        <div class="message">
            What we've built together feels so precious to me, and I want to keep building something even more beautiful
            with you. I want to be there for all your tomorrows, through everything life brings our way.
